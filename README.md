# Bayesian-button-pressing
A Bayesian network simulation of a button-pressing task in schizophrenic patients. Directly influenced by http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008301/. Main methods are seqprob.m and seqprobr.m-they both include essentially the same content but differ slightly in the algorithms used to calculate posteriors, etc.
